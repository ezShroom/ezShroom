# ðŸ‘‹ Hi
I'm a developer looking to write code for [LBRY](https://lbry.com/). I'd like to expand its ecosystem outside of Odysee, its most visited platform.  

## ðŸ‘‰ Projects
Here are the open source projects I've made or worked on.

### [Actarius](https://github.com/Shroom2020/actarius-lbry-browser)
An Electron-based browser for LBRY built to showcase how the LBRY protocol can be applied in various ways, outside of the standard 'YouTube Clone' interfaces that dominate the ecosystem right now.
### [gobackup](https://github.com/Shroom2020/gobackup)
A Minecraft backup mod that uploads to [Gofile](https://gofile.io/) through its $5/mo API. Built to avoid `sh` limitations with hosts like PebbleHost.
